# Float notes!

Float notes is a __multi-board-note-editing-system__ built in React. It has an App component that keeps track of board IDs, linked to a NoteBoard component which keeps track of the notes. The notes can be edited and dragged around, all in real time. Each Note is a semi-dumb component that renders props from NoteBoard, but it keeps one boolean of whether it is edited.

Most of float notes works as expected, but if it were to be improved in the future, customizable colors, name-able boards, removable boards, resizable notes, are all considered to be added!
